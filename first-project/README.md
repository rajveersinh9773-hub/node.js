## 🧠 How It Works

1. Imports the built-in `http` module.
2. Creates a server using `http.createServer()`.
3. Sends a response to the browser with `res.end()`.
4. Starts the server on port `3000`.

});

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```
